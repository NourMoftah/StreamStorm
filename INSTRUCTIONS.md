## Requirements

* To use one channel you need to have at least 300MB of free RAM available on your system. The more channels you use, the more RAM is required

## Using The Application

### Step 1. Create Temp Profiles

* Creating temp profiles is the first step to use the application.
    - In the application UI, click on the `Manage Profiles` button.
    - Enter number of profiles you want to create.
    - Click on the `Create Profiles` button.
* The application will open a browser window and it will prompt you to log in to your YouTube account
* Login to your YouTube account in the browser window that opens.
* After logging in, the application will fetch all the channels available in your YouTube account.
* After fetching the channels, the application will first close itself, and start creating the profiles.
* Each temp profile will take up to `150MB` of storage space.

The reason for creating all these profiles is that, each channel will require a separate profile to avoid any conflicts or issues with opening the browser window, since one browser window locks its own profile from being accessed by another instance of the same browser.

`There is also provision to delete all temp profiles created by the application, in case you want to start fresh.`

### Step 2. Starting The Storm

First Open the application and make sure you have created the temp profiles as mentioned in `Step 1.`

    6. **Slow mode**
       * Some channels have slow mode enabled, which means you can only send a limited number of messages in a fixed time.

           * The application will select the channels from the start index to the end index you provided.
       * Advanced
